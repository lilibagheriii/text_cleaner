# Text Cleaner ðŸ§¹

This is a simple Python project that cleans text by:
- Converting to lowercase
- Removing punctuation

## How it works

- `text_cleaner.py`: Cleans a sample text.
- `text_cleaner_v2.py`: Reads text from a file, cleans it, and writes the cleaned version to another file.
- `word_count_nlp.py`: (Optional) Counts word frequencies using NLTK.

## How to run

```bash
python3 text_cleaner.py
